# Micropython-Projects :tw-2b07: 
MicroPython is a slim and efficient version of Python 3 designed for microcontrollers and constrained environments. It includes a small subset of the Python standard library and runs on the MicroPython pyboard, an electronic circuit board. Despite its small size, MicroPython offers advanced features like an interactive prompt, closures, generators, and exception handling. It aims to be highly compatible with regular Python, facilitating code transfer between desktop and embedded systems. You can find all the information that you want in the official website at [micropython.org.](http://https://micropython.org/ "micropython.org.")

### About this repository:tw-26a1:
The repository I have created focuses on embedded systems projects using **MicroPython**, leveraging various electronic components to develop innovative solutions. These projects cover various applications, from controlling an **ESP32** to implementing a visualization system on **7-segment displays**. In addition, advanced concepts are explored through the creation of an **Avoiding Obstacles Robot**, using an `ultrasonic sensor, servo motors, geared motors, and the L298N driver`, as well as a** Line Follower Robot ** where MicroPython is used to intelligently control the movement of the carriage using infrared sensors to detect and follow a line drawn on the ground. Using algorithms and control techniques, the cart can adjust its direction and stay on the set path, making it a fascinating example of the application of MicroPython in embedded systems.

Also included are examples of remote control via **Bluetooth**,** sound generation**, **greenhouse automation**, **display on LCD** screens using the` I2C protocol`, reading temperature and humidity sensors with the `DHT module`, **stepper motor control**, **line tracking**,** motion detection** with the `PIR sensor`, and interaction with a **matrix keyboard**, as well as connection to **WiFi networks.**
